  <p>
   If you wonder why your set up stills looks bad even after you followed our steps then perhaps you should try de-clutering 
   your office space, somethimes all it needs is to lose a lil bit of self to become perfect. I would
  also recomend you get a cable box and cabel brackets to keep yours wires managed.
